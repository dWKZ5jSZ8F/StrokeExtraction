# Stroke extraction based on ambiguous zone detection

## Introduction
In this repo, a stroke extraction algorithm is implemented in Matlab. Degrade spurrious branches or skeleton deformations.maximum circle criterion and double threshold method.
Used feature points in thinned image and surrounding contour informations.
