# Stroke extraction based on ambiguous zone detection

## Introduction
This is an implementation of the paper by Su, Z. et al. [^1]. The ultimate goal is to recover dynamic information of handwritten Chinese characters using stroke extraction method based on ambiguous zone detection.

## Method
The general representation of the entire process is as depicted in the flowchart below:

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    A[Preprocessing] --> B[Feature point detection];
    A[Preprocessing] --> C[Contour extraction];
    subgraph Ambiguity detection
        B[Feature point detection] --> D[Ambiguous zone identification];
        C[Contour extraction] --> D[Ambiguous zone identification];
    end
    subgraph Stroke extraction
        D[Ambiguous zone identification] --> E[Graph representation];
        E[Graph representation] --> F[Continuity analysis];
        F[Continuity analysis] --> G[Stroke path searching];
        G[Stroke path searching] --> H[B-spline interpolation];
    end   
```
